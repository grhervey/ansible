# ansible

This is my ansible repository. I will be using this repository to store all my ansible playbooks and roles.
Notes:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ansible
 
we still need to figure out the ssh keys
there is an issue when adding the npm to the path and that creates problems of installing specific version with n

still need to set up:
	kubernetes
	1password
	dotfiles
	securety for work
	obsidian
